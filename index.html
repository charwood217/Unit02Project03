        <h2>Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> Unplug</li>
        <li> Interact</li>
        <li> Reconnect</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
        that bring people together through shared experiences.<br> With 
        all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
        that from a computer screen. Sometimes you<br> need the 
        intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
        a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>
        
        <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
        heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
        hundreds<br> of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
        simulations, role-playing<br> games, and so much more. 
        If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
        probably have it in our antiques collection.<br> If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p>
        
        <p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
        gaming and the company of good friends. 
        Our game room is<br> free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
        a game from our demo library and start playing. 
        We sponsor tournaments, challenges,<br> and special 
        social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>
        
        <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
        publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
        our reviews of Towers and<br> Temples and Alliance; both 
        new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
